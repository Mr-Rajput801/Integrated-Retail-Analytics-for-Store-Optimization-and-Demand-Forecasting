## Integrated Retail Analytics for Store Optimization

Objective:To utilize machine learning and data analysis techniques to optimize store performance, forecast demand, and enhance customer experience through segmentation and personalized marketing strategies.

## Project Components

## Anomaly Detection in Sales Data

Identify unusual sales patterns across stores and departments.

Investigate potential causes (e.g., holidays, markdowns, economic indicators).

Implement anomaly handling strategies to clean the data for further analysis.

## Time-Based Anomaly Detection

Analyze sales trends over time.

Detect seasonal variations and holiday effects on sales.

Use time-series analysis to understand store and department performance over time.

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

Handle missing values, especially in the MarkDown data.

Create new features that could influence sales (e.g., store size/type, regional factors).

## Customer Segmentation Analysis

Segment stores or departments based on sales patterns, markdowns, and regional features.

Analyze segment-specific trends and characteristics using K-Means Clustering.

Evaluate segmentation quality using the silhouette score metric.

## Market Basket Analysis

Although individual customer transaction data is not available, infer potential product associations within departments using sales data.

Develop cross-selling strategies based on these inferences using the Apriori Algorithm.

## Demand Forecasting

Build models to forecast weekly sales for each store and department.

Incorporate factors like CPI, unemployment rate, fuel prices, and store/dept attributes.

Explore short-term (SARIMA) and long-term (Random Forest) forecasting models.

Use the Holt-Winters Model for seasonality-based forecasting.

## Impact of External Factors

Examine how economic indicators and regional climate influence sales.

Incorporate these insights into the demand forecasting models.

## Personalization Strategies

Develop personalized marketing strategies based on markdowns and store segments.

Propose inventory management strategies tailored to store and department needs.

## Segmentation Quality Evaluation

Use the silhouette score metric to assess segmentation quality.

Determine the optimal number of clusters for store and department segmentation (found to be 4).

## Personalization Strategies by Segments

Store Segments:

Cluster 0: Premium Space Retailers & Sizeable Luxury Stores

Cluster 1: Value-Oriented Stores

Cluster 2: Budget-Friendly Stores

Cluster 3: Compact Elegance Stores

Department Segments:

Cluster 0: Sizeable Luxury Departments

Cluster 1: Premium Selection Departments

Cluster 2: Elite Departments

Cluster 3: Grand Outlets Department

## Real-World Application and Strategy Formulation

Formulate a comprehensive strategy for inventory management, marketing, and store optimization based on the insights gathered.

Discuss potential real-world challenges in implementing these strategies.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Techniques

Visualize data using Barplots, Linecharts, Violinplots, and Correlation matrices.

Techniques Used for Anomaly Detection and Mitigation

Calculate summary statistics using mean, median, and standard deviation.

## Strategies to mitigate anomalies without removing data points:

Data Cleaning

Data Normalization

Data Imputation

## Time-Based Anomaly Detection Techniques

Rolling Statistics: Compute rolling averages, moving sums, and standard deviations.

Exponential Smoothing: Use exponential moving averages (EMA) for anomaly detection.

Highlighting Anomalies: Set thresholds and visual cues to detect deviations from smoothed values.

## Models Used for Demand Forecasting in Retail Data

Short-term forecasting model (SARIMA): Predicting future events or values over a relatively brief period, often within weeks or months, for immediate operational decisions.

Long-term forecasting model (Random Forest): Predicting future trends and values over an extended period, typically spanning months to years, for strategic planning and decision-making.

Holt-Winters Model (Triple Exponential Smoothing): Forecast future weekly sales for each store and department, accounting for level, trend, and seasonality components.

This project aims to apply these methodologies to optimize store performance and enhance business decision-making through advanced analytics and machine learning models.
